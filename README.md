# 🌎 Common Market 🌍
### _The universal Common Market validated by the Solana blockchain_


To ensure a decentralized future where transaction fees are zero and the possibilities of doing business are endless, the idea of the Common Market is postulated as an alternative to centralized and state-regulated transactions today. This project is open source and secure, with the user's privacy being the main concern of the program.Some of the highlights of the program are:

- Zero fees
- Operational anonymity
- Structural decentralization

Due to its decentralized nature and focused on the international market of all goods and services sold and purchased by individuals, it was made necessary that the execution of this program is not on 2.0 servers/browsers, but rather on 3.0 browsers validated by blockchain. This characteristic positions us as one of the main international markets impossible to eliminate under government restrictions.
